# Weather Forecasting and Prediction Web App

## Overview
This project is a web application that forecasts weather conditions and predicts rain and humidity using a Random Forest model. The app fetches live weather data via an external Weather API and processes it to generate predictions. The web app is developed using Django, with an interactive front-end built using HTML and CSS.

## Technologies Used
- Back-End: Django
- Machine Learning Model: Random Forest Regressor, Random Forest Classifier
- API Integration: Weather API for live data retrieval
- Front-End: HTML, CSS
- Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn

## Features
- Fetches live weather data (temperature, wind speed, pressure, etc.) using a Weather API.
- Predicts rain likelihood and humidity levels using a trained Random Forest model.
- User-friendly web interface for entering city names and viewing forecasts.
- Clean and responsive front-end design.
